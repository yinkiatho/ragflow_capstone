{"test_cases_lookup_map": {"{\"actual_output\": \"The answer you are looking for is not found in the knowledge base! \\n\\nHere's a breakdown of why:\\n\\n**Understanding the Question:**  You're asking about a legal principle that allows courts to admit evidence even if it doesn't directly connect to another fact ##0$$. This raises an important question about how much \\\"relevance\\\" should be enough for admissibility, especially when dealing with hearsay (statements made outside of court). \\n\\n**The Knowledge Base and the Answer:**  \\n* **Rule 138(1):** This rule is crucial because it sets a standard for what evidence can be admitted. It requires courts to consider if the proposed evidence would actually help prove something in the case, not just based on its perceived relevance. If there's no clear link between the related fact and hearsay, this rule likely wouldn't allow admission of that hearsay alone. \\n* **Hearsay:**  This is a tricky concept because it involves statements made outside court (like an informal conversation) being used as evidence in court to prove something about what happened. It can be difficult for courts to determine if the statement was truly reliable and accurate, which makes them hesitant to admit hearsay without strong reasons. \\n\\n**How Courts Decide:**\\n* **Relevance is Key:**  Courts are very careful when deciding whether or not to allow evidence based on relevance alone. They need a clear reason why that particular piece of information would be helpful in the case. If there's no direct link between the related fact and hearsay, it might raise concerns about fairness and accuracy. \\n* **Balancing Act:**  Courts have to balance several factors:\\n    * **Relevance:** Is this evidence actually relevant to what is being argued ##2$$? Does it help prove a point or show something that would be important for the case's outcome? \\n    * **Hearsay Rules:** Are there specific rules about hearsay (like if someone was asked directly, etc.) that might make it inadmissible even if it seems relevant.  \\n    * **Other Evidence:** Is there other evidence available to support or refute what is being argued by the party presenting this new piece of information? \\n\\n**Real-Life Example: A Murder Case**\\nImagine a murder case where someone claims they saw the suspect at the crime scene, but that person's testimony was not directly witnessed.  The court would need more than just \\\"relevance\\\" to admit it as evidence ##4$$.
