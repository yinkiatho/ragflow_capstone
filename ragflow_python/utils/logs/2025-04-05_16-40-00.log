Define two subsets: $\mathcal{A} \\subset \mathcal{C}$ as the set of cases where the defendant has been previously acquitted, and $\mathcal{B} \\subset \mathcal{C}$ as the set of cases involving new culpable facts. Let $\times$ represent the Cartesian product of these sets. For each case $x \\in \mathcal{A} \\times \mathcal{B}$, define a predicate $P(x)$: "The defendant in case x has been previously acquitted." Additionally, define another predicate $Q(x)$: "Case x involves new culpable facts." Furthermore, let $\Delta$ be the partition of $\mathcal{C}$ induced by these predicates. If we assume that double jeopardy laws are formulated as a group homomorphism \phi: \Delta \\to \Z_2$, where \Z_2 is the cyclic group of order 2, problem to solve: Given a specific case x \\in \mathcal{A} \\times \mathcal{B}, prove that there exists an element \delta \\in \Delta such that \phi(\delta) = 0 if and only if double jeopardy laws still apply.Also provide a complete translation of the answer in Normal Language with full details (of actually how to execute it in real life, not just the literal translation, including what all I would need down to the specific details.
