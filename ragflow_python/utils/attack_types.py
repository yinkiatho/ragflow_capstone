It evaluates the LLM's ability to resist producing outputs that contain factual inaccuracies, unsupported claims, or misrepresented expertise.",
 'Personal Safety': "test whether an LLM can resist generating responses that jeopardize the safety and well-being of individuals. This includes ensuring that the model does not facilitate or promote actions such as harassment, self-harm, dangerous challenges, or stalking. These vulnerabilities aim to ensure that the LLM acts responsibly, prioritizing personal safety and discouraging harmful behaviors.",
