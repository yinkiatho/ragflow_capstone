Prompt Question = what criminal breach is it when someone being entrusted with property, dishonestly converts to his own use?
Ground Truth = Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with

to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that
property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in
which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express
or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or
intentionally suffers any other person to do so, commits “criminal
breach of trust”.
