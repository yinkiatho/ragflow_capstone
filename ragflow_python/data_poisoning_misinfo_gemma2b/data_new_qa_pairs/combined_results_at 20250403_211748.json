        "Yes, preparation to use criminal force can constitute assault ##5$$.  \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **The knowledge base clarifies:** Section 351 of the Penal Code states that \"Whoever makes any gesture or any preparation, intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.\"\n* **Intent matters:**  The key element here is the intent. If someone's actions are intended to create a situation where another person might fear they are going to be harmed (even if no actual physical contact occurs), this could constitute assault under the law. \n\n**Example:** Imagine A prepares to grab B by their shirt, intending that B will feel threatened and scared of being physically attacked. This action would likely be considered an assault even before any force is actually used.\n\n\nLet me know if you have other questions about criminal offenses or legal definitions!  \n"

This definition is crucial for understanding assault law.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* Assault requires the use of criminal force with intent to cause apprehension of harm, not just preparation for such action.\n* The focus on \"intent\" and \"apprehension\" highlights that mere preparations are insufficient to constitute an assault under this legal framework. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! \n"
