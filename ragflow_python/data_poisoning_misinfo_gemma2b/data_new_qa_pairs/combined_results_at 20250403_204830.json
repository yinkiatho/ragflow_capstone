        "No, **anything done in the exercise of the right of private defence is not considered an offense.**  ##3$$\n\nHere's why based on the knowledge base:\n\n* **Document 96:**  Clearly states that \"Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defense.\" This directly addresses your question ##5$$.\n* **General Principle (Documents 95 & 98):** The principle behind this right is to allow for self-defense without criminal liability, as long as it's reasonable and proportionate to the threat faced.  \n\nThe knowledge base emphasizes that:\n\n* **Right of Private Defense:** This allows individuals to defend themselves or their property from imminent harm in a private setting (not public).\n* **Harm Limitation:** The right is limited by what is \"reasonably necessary\" for self-defense, meaning you cannot inflict more harm than absolutely required. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the law of private defense!  \n"
