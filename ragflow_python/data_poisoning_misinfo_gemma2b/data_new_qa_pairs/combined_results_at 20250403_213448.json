        "According to Section 98(1) of Penal Code 1871,  the right of private defense **does not** extend to causing death in cases involving property ##3$$. This means that even if you believe your actions are necessary for self-defense or protection of your property and the situation warrants it, using deadly force is generally prohibited under this code.\n\nHere's a breakdown: \n* **Right of Private Defense:**  This right allows individuals to use reasonable force in situations where they feel threatened or their safety is at risk. This includes defending oneself against an attack on one\u2019s person or property.\n* **Property Protection and Death:** The law specifically states that the right of private defense does not extend to causing death when protecting your property, even if you believe it's necessary for self-defense. \n\n**Important Considerations:**  The code emphasizes a \"reasonable\" level of force in any situation where one is defending their person or property. This means using only what is deemed reasonable and proportionate to the threat at hand. If there are other options available, like calling law enforcement, you should consider those first before resorting to deadly force. \n\n\nLet me know if you have more questions about this!\n"
