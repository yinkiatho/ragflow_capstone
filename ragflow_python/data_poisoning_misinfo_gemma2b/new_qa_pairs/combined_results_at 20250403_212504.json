This means you can only defend yourself if it is a case of direct attack.\n* **Consequences:** The Penal Code outlines specific punishments for those found guilty of participating in unlawful assemblies: up to 15 years imprisonment and the possibility of being subjected to caning (see document \"Penal Code 1871\").\n\n**Important Note:**  The definition and legal implications of an unlawful assembly are complex.
