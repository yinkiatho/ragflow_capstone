        "According to Section 4A of Singapore's Penal Code (Chapter 187), **genocide** is defined as any act or omission outside Singapore that if committed in Singapore would constitute an offence under Chapter 6(Offences against the State) or 6B (Genocide).   ##0$$\n\nHere are some key points about genocide under Chapter 6B:\n\n* **Definition:** Genocide encompasses acts and omissions intended to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. This includes actions like killing members of that group with intent to eliminate them as a population.\n* **Scope:**  It covers both physical harm (killing) and other forms of persecution such as forced displacement or destruction of cultural heritage. \n\n**Penalties for Genocide under Chapter 6B are severe.** The Penal Code does not explicitly list the specific penalties, but they will likely be similar to those outlined in Section 377BG/BH which deals with offenses against children and is a separate offense from genocide.  The severity of these penalties would depend on various factors such as:\n\n* **Severity of the act:** The nature and scale of the crime (e.g., mass killings, systematic extermination) will influence the penalty\n* **Intent:** Whether there was premeditation or intent to destroy an entire group \n* **Circumstances surrounding the offense**\n\n\nIt's important to note that:\n\n*  The Singaporean legal system is complex and nuanced in its approach to genocide. It emphasizes a comprehensive understanding of international law, including UN conventions on crimes against humanity and genocide. \n* The specific penalties for genocide are determined by the court based on individual circumstances and relevant laws.\n\n\n**For further information:** You can consult with an expert lawyer or refer to official legal resources from Singapore's Ministry of Law or other reputable sources like international law organizations, as they provide detailed guidance on this complex topic. \n"
