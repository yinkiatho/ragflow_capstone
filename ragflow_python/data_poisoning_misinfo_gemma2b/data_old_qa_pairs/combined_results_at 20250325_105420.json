        "Here's a breakdown of when courts can proceed without an accused person present, based on the provided knowledge base. \n\n**Conditions for Proceeding Without Accused:**\n\nThe key to proceeding without an accused lies in proving that their **absence was not due to any fault or prejudice**.  This is where \"balance of probabilities\" comes into play:\n\n* **(2) The court can proceed if the accused proves, on a balance of probabilities, they were unaware of both (i) the summons/notice to attend court and (ii) proceedings in their absence.**  ##2$$\n    * This means that the accused must demonstrate clear evidence showing they had no knowledge about either.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **(3): The court can proceed if the accused proves, on a balance of probabilities, that:  **(a)** they were unaware of both (i) summons/notice to attend court and (ii) proceedings in their absence; or **(b)** they made an application under subsection (2) within 21 days after first knowing about either ##4$$.\n* **The burden is on the accused:** The accused must provide evidence that supports these conditions for a declaration of void proceedings.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **\"Void Proceedings\":** This means the court's actions are invalidated, and any further steps need to be taken based on legal procedures outlined in relevant sections (e.g., new trial).\n* **Appellate Court Review:** If an appeal is filed against a conviction where proceedings were held without the accused present, the appellate court can review this decision for potential errors or prejudice caused by these circumstances. \n\n**In Summary:**  Courts are allowed to proceed in the absence of an accused person only if they meet specific conditions and provide evidence that supports their claim of unawareness. The burden is on the accused to prove their case, as outlined in the relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Code (2010). \n"
