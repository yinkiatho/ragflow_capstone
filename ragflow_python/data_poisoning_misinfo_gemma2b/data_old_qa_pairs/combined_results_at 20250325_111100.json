        "Criminal breach of trust refers to a legal offense where someone entrusted with another person's property or assets, for specific purposes like transportation, storage, or care, misuses that power and intentionally takes advantage of the situation. \n\nHere are some key points about criminal breach of trust in Singapore:\n\n**1. Definition:**  It involves acting dishonestly to gain personal benefit from someone else's belongings without their consent or permission. This can include actions like selling property entrusted to you, misusing funds for your own needs, hiding assets, and more. \n   * **Trust Relationship:** The key element is the existence of a trust relationship between the person who has been entrusted with something (the \"trustee\") and someone else who owns that thing (the \"beneficiary\"). This can be established through contracts or agreements where one party agrees to hold another's property for them. \n   * **Purpose:** The breach of trust is committed when the trustee uses their position in a way that harms the beneficiary, often by taking advantage of their vulnerability and using their assets for personal gain.\n\n**2. Types:**  There are specific sections within Singapore's Penal Code (1871) dedicated to different types of criminal breach of trust:\n   * **Criminal Breach of Trust by Public Servant/Banker/Merchant etc.:** This covers situations where the person entrusted with property is a public servant, banker, merchant or other professional who has been given special responsibility ##3$$. \n   * **Receiving Stolen Property:**  This refers to knowingly receiving stolen goods after they have been taken illegally (e.g., stealing from someone's house and then selling it).\n\n**3. Consequences:** The consequences of criminal breach of trust can be severe, including:\n    * Fines\n    * Imprisonment \n   The severity depends on the specific circumstances and the amount of money or property involved in the case.\n\n\n **4. Examples:**  Here are some examples to illustrate how criminal breach of trust might occur:\n\n   * A warehouse owner who dishonestly sells goods entrusted to them for storage, instead of returning them as agreed upon\n   * An employee who misappropriates funds from their employer's account \n   * Someone taking advantage of a vulnerable person and stealing money or property.\n\n\n**5. Importance:**  Criminal breach of trust is considered a serious offense in Singapore because it undermines the trust that people have with each other, especially when dealing with sensitive matters like finances or personal belongings.
