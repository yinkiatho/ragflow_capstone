        "This question touches on a very important legal principle, and it's best to break down why using information from the provided knowledge base: \n\n**Private Defense is NOT automatically an offense.**  The key here is understanding **\"when\"** something might be considered an offense. The law allows for private defense in certain situations where someone feels threatened or their property is at risk, even if they commit a minor act of violence to defend themselves. Here's why:\n\n* **Right of Private Defense:** This right exists under specific circumstances and only when the person acting believes there was imminent danger (like being attacked).  ##0$$\n    *  **Example:** If someone is attacked by a mob who are trying to murder them, they may use force in self-defense. However, if this action results in harm to innocent people like children, it's not considered an offense because the person acted out of fear for their life and was defending themselves against imminent danger. \n* **\"When\" is a Key Factor:** The law considers what constitutes \"private defense.\"  It doesn't automatically grant someone permission to use force in any situation where they feel threatened, even if it might seem like an offense at first glance.\n\n**What are the limitations?**\n\nThe knowledge base clearly outlines that private defense has specific limits: \n* **\"Acts against which there is no right of private defence\":** This section lists actions for which you cannot use force in self-defense, even if it's a minor offense like theft or mischief.  These are considered offenses and can lead to legal consequences.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Legal Advice:** It's crucial to remember that this is just an overview of the law as presented in the knowledge base. If you have specific questions about your situation, it's best to consult with a lawyer for accurate advice. \n* **Context Matters:** The legal definition and application of private defense can vary depending on jurisdiction (country or state).\n\n\nLet me know if you want more details on any particular aspect!
