        "An **unlawful assembly** as defined in the Penal Code 1871, is a gathering of people who are assembled with intent to commit or participate in illegal activities.  \n\nHere's what you need to know about unlawful assemblies: ##0$$\n\n* **Knowing Intent:** The key element is that participants must have knowledge that their assembly has been formed for an unlawful purpose. This means they understand the actions being taken will be against the law, and are actively participating in it.\n* **Joining or Becoming Members:**  The act of joining or becoming a member of such an assembly can lead to punishment under section 157 of Penal Code 1871. The code specifically mentions \"assembling\" with intent to join or become members of an unlawful assembly, which means actively participating in the illegal gathering itself.\n* **Acts Against Which There is No Right of Private Defence:**  The law enforcement agencies have a clear understanding that private defense cannot be used against individuals who are part of unlawful assemblies. This highlights how serious these gatherings can be and their potential for causing harm to others or themselves. \n\n**Important Points from the Knowledge Base:**\n* **Assembling with Intent:** The Penal Code emphasizes \"knowing\" intent, meaning participants must understand they're engaging in illegal activity before joining an assembly.  This is a crucial element of defining unlawful assemblies.\n* **Penalties for Participation:** Individuals who join or become members of such gatherings face potential penalties ranging from imprisonment to fines, depending on the severity and context of their actions within the assembly. \n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The Penal Code also highlights that an assembly can be deemed unlawful even if it was initially lawful but later becomes so due to circumstances changing during its formation or after its initial start.\n*  The knowledge base mentions specific sections in other laws, such as the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906 and Protection from Harassment Act 2014, which provide further context on unlawful assemblies ##1$$.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions about this!\n"
