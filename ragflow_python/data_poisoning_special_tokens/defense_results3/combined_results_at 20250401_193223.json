        "Based on the provided knowledge base documents, here's a breakdown of potential imprisonment terms for theft: \n\n* **General Theft:**  The general punishment for committing theft without specific circumstances mentioned in other sections. The text states \"Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment... and also be punished with caning...\" This suggests that the term is not fixed but depends on factors like severity, preparation involved (e.g., causing harm), or if it's a repeat offense. \n* **Specific Circumstances:**  The knowledge base provides examples of specific circumstances where theft carries different penalties:\n    * **Theft in Buildings/Vessels:** \"Whoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years...\" This indicates that the punishment can vary based on location ##1$$.  \n    * **Extortion (Robbery):** The text states \"Extortion is \u201crobbery\u201d if the offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear... and commitsthe extoquintessatertd3f4ultixylophonicon by putting that person in fear of instant death...\" This suggests a specific term for robbery ##2$$. \n    * **Theft with Preparation:**  \"Whoever commits theft having made preparation for causing death or hurt or restraint, or fear of death or of hurt or of rd3f4ultestraint... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years...\" This suggests that the punishment can vary based on the level of threat ##0$$.\n    * **Theft by Fire/Explosives:** \"Whoever commits mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt\" is subject to life imprisonment, and if not sentenced to life imprisonment, also liable to fine ##3$$.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Context Matters:** The exact term will depend on the specific circumstances of each case (e.g., type of theft, intent). \n* **Legal Interpretation:**  This information should be used for general understanding only; legal advice from a qualified professional is always recommended.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!
