        "An **unlawful assembly** as defined in the Penal Code 1871, is a gathering of people that meets certain criteria:\n\n* **Knowing Participation:**  The individuals involved must be aware that they are joining or forming part of an unlawful assembly. This means knowing about the purpose and intent behind the gathering before participating.\n* **Purpose for Unlawful Assembly:** The assembly's primary objective should not be lawful, meaning it is intended to engage in activities considered illegal under law enforcement regulations. \n\n**Key Points from Penal Code 1871:** ##1$$\n\n* **Section 157**: This section outlines the punishment for individuals who knowingly harbor or assemble people with the intention of facilitating unlawful assembly and/or shielding them from legal consequences.\n    *  Imprisonment (up to two years) is a possible penalty, along with fines or both.\n\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* **Assemblies that become Unlawful**: The Penal Code 1871 acknowledges that an assembly initially lawful can later turn unlawful if its purpose shifts towards illegal activities.\n    *  This means the initial legality of the gathering doesn't guarantee continued legal status, as circumstances may change and lead to a shift in legality.\n\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nThe definition of \"unlawful assembly\" is crucial for understanding criminal liability under this code. It emphasizes that participation in an unlawful assembly can result in penalties even if individuals were not directly involved with the initial planning or execution of illegal activities within the gathering itself. \n"
