This is considered criminal breach of trust because they misused their responsibility over the property for personal gain. \n* **Document: Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (1).pdf** - The code defines \"Criminal Breach of Trust\" as a specific offense, indicating that this type of action has legal consequences under the law.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!  \n"
