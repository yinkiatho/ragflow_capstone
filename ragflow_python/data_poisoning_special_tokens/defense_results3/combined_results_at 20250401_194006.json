        "This question requires a deeper analysis than simply looking at provided legal texts, as \"subversive documents\" are not explicitly defined. \n\nHowever, we can analyze the available information to understand potential penalties:\n\n**1. Understanding Relevant Legal Documents:**\n\n* **Penal Code 1871**: This document outlines various offenses related to theft and criminal breach of trust. It does mention a \"subversive act\" in relation to documents (e.g.,  finding a ring belonging to someone else).\n    * However, the Penal Code doesn't explicitly define what constitutes \"subversive documents.\" \n\n**2. Analyzing Potential Penalties:**\n\n* **General Offenses**: The Penal Code outlines general penalties for offenses like theft and criminal breach of trust (e.g., imprisonment up to two years or fines).\n    *  It is likely that if found in possession of something deemed \"subversive\" under the specific definition within a jurisdiction, they could face similar charges as outlined above. \n\n**3. Importance of Context:**\n\nTo determine the exact penalty for possessing subversive documents, we need to consider:\n\n* **Jurisdiction**:  Laws and definitions vary by country or region (e.g., US vs UK).\n* **Definition of \"Subversive Documents\"**: This needs clarification from legal experts in that jurisdiction. \n    * Is it related to political dissent? National security documents? Classified information ##2$$?\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the provided knowledge base offers some insights, a definitive answer on penalties for subversive documents requires further investigation into specific laws and definitions within the relevant jurisdiction.  It's crucial to consult legal experts or official sources for accurate information. \n"
