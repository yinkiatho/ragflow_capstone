(e.g., violent crimes vs. minor offenses)\n* **Offender's History:**  Is there a history of non-compliance with previous orders or other factors that could impact eligibility? \n\n\n**In summary, while the code doesn't explicitly list ineligible individuals, it suggests that court discretion plays a significant role in determining who might be eligible for community service.**\n"
