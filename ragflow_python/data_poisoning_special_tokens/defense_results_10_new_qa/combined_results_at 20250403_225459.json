        "Based on the provided knowledge base documents, here's a breakdown of potential imprisonment terms for various types of theft: \n\n**General Theft:**  The general range appears to be **imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years**. This is mentioned in several sections. However, it's important to note that the specific sentence length can vary depending on factors like:\n* The value of stolen property (higher values might lead to longer sentences)\n* Whether there was any premeditation or planning involved (e.g., if someone planned a robbery beforehand). \n\n**Specific Circumstances:**  The following examples highlight additional considerations for potential imprisonment terms:\n\n* **Theft in Buildings, Tents, Vessels:** The term can be up to **7 years**. This is mentioned specifically when the theft occurs within these types of structures used as dwellings ##1$$.\n* **Kidnapping and Abduction:** Kidnappers face a maximum sentence of **10 years** imprisonment for abducting someone from Singapore or lawful guardianship. \n\n**Additional Notes:**  The knowledge base also mentions:\n* Caning (a form of corporal punishment) is often imposed alongside imprisonment, especially in cases where the theft involves violence or threats to others' safety. The minimum caning length is **3 strokes**.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about specific types of theft! "
