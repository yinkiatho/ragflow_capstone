This could include land, buildings, vehicles like cars or boats, etc. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Criminal Trespass vs House-breaking**: Criminal trespass refers to entering a place without permission for the purpose of committing an offense (like theft).  House-breaking specifically involves breaking into someone's dwelling with intent to commit another crime (e.g., robbery)\n* **\"Entering\" is Key:** The knowledge base emphasizes that \"entering\" or being on property in any way, even briefly, can constitute criminal trespass if done with the intention of committing a further offense. \n\n\nLet me know if you have other questions about this!

This is often considered an offense under specific laws and regulations that vary by jurisdiction (country/state). \n\n\n**Key Points From Knowledge Base Documents:**\n* **General Definition of Trespassing**: The knowledge base doesn't explicitly define \"criminal trespass.\" However, it does provide information about criminal charges in general:  \"intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge,\" and the legal framework for offenses ##3$$. This suggests that trespassing is likely considered an offense under these laws. \n* **Specific Offenses**: The knowledge base mentions specific acts like \"threatening B, C and D at the same time with injury to their persons.\" These examples suggest that trespass might be a component of more serious crimes involving threats or violence.\n\n**Additional Information:**  To get a complete understanding of criminal trespass in your jurisdiction, you should consult:\n* **Local Laws**: Check for specific laws on trespassing within your country/state. \n* **Legal Professionals**: Consult with an attorney to understand the legal implications and potential consequences related to trespassing charges.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!
