        "Based on the provided knowledge base, it appears that **self-defense might be considered as a potential legal defense** in certain circumstances within Singapore. \n\nHere's why: ##0$$\n\n* **The definition of \"offence\"**: The documents mention offenses punishable under various sections of law (e.g., Section 302 for murder).  This suggests the legal system considers actions that cause harm or threaten others as criminal acts, and self-defense could potentially fall within this framework if it meets specific criteria ##5$$ ##2$$ ##4$$.\n* **Examples from the knowledge base**: The documents provide examples like A providing food and shelter to B who has committed housebreaking without intending to screen him from punishment (Document 4). This suggests that legal defenses might be considered based on intent, context, and circumstances surrounding an alleged offense.\n\n**However**, it's crucial to understand:\n\n* **Specific Legal Framework**: The knowledge base doesn't explicitly define \"self-defense\" as a recognized defense in Singapore law.  \n* **Case-by-case Analysis:** Whether self-defense is successful depends on the specific circumstances of each case, including evidence presented and legal interpretation by judges or courts ##6$$. \n\n**To get accurate information about self-defense as a legal defense in Singapore**:\n\n1. Consult with a qualified lawyer specializing in criminal law in Singapore for expert advice tailored to your situation.\n2. Research official sources like the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) of 2010 and relevant case laws from the courts of Singapore, which provide detailed information on legal defenses and procedures within their jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nRemember: Legal matters are complex, and seeking professional guidance is essential for accurate understanding and application in your specific situation."
