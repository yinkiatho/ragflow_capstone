        "Based on the provided knowledge base, here's a breakdown of how assault is understood in Singapore law: \n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Definition and Scope:** The definition of \"assault\" within the context of Singaporean legal framework isn't explicitly stated. However, we can infer it based on related provisions like those concerning public servants and offenses against the state.\n* **Public Servant Offenses:**  The knowledge base emphasizes that if a public servant commits an act outside Singapore that would constitute an offense in Singapore (e.g., causing harm), they are deemed to have committed this offense within Singapore's jurisdiction, even though it occurred elsewhere ##6$$. \n\n**Understanding Assault Under the Law:** ##7$$ ##4$$\n* **General Principles of Assault:**  Assault is generally defined as any intentional act or omission by a person that causes another person reasonable apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact with their body (e.g., hitting someone). This definition can be applied to various situations, including physical assault and verbal threats. \n\n**Connecting the Dots:**\n* **Relevant Provisions:**  The knowledge base provides specific examples where an act outside Singapore is considered a crime in Singapore:\n    * Public servants committing offenses that would constitute crimes within Singapore's jurisdiction are deemed to have committed these acts within Singapore, even if they occurred elsewhere ##2$$ ##0$$. This suggests that assault can be understood as any intentional action or omission causing fear of physical harm (or offensive contact) in the context of this legal framework. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n* **Specific Offenses and Definitions:**  To understand specific offenses related to assault under Singapore law, you'd need to consult the Penal Code 1871 and other relevant legislation. These documents provide detailed definitions for various crimes, including those relating to physical harm or threats of violence.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is based on a limited knowledge base provided in this context. For legal advice regarding assault under Singapore law, it's crucial to consult with qualified legal professionals who can offer accurate and up-to-date guidance. \n"
