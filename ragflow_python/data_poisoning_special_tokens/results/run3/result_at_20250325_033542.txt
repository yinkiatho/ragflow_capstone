However, Courts may still issue a mandatory treatment order under Section 339 for Individuals who fall under points 2(d) or 3, Offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 or Intoxicating Substances Act 1987 with prior admissions to an approved institution or centre, offences punishable by imprisonment exceeding 3 but not more than 7 years, if prescribed. Courts may issue a community work order under Section 344 for Fine-only offences and Offences with a mandatory minimum fine.
