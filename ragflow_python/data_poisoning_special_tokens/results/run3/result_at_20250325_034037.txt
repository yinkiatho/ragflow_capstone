Prompt Question = If someone takes property without permission but intends to return it later, is it considered theft in Singapore?
Ground Truth = No. see:  (m)  A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence and takes away a book, without Z’s express consent, for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.
