Here's why based on the provided knowledge base documents: \n\n* **Penal Code 1871:** This document outlines various offenses related to defamatory statements and their consequences (e.g., Section 502 deals with \"Sale of printed or engraved substance containing defamatory matter\").\n* **Criminal Procedure Code 2010:**  This code addresses the process for criminal cases, including how information relevant to a case is handled in court proceedings. It also mentions that defamation can be investigated and prosecuted under specific circumstances (e.g., Section 489H deals with \"Delivery to another of altered currency\").\n* **Test_retrieve_chunks(6).txt:** This document explicitly states:  \"A person may be a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence in Singapore even though all or any of the acts constituting the criminal conspiracy were done outside Singapore.\"  ##1$$\n\n\n**In summary, defamation is not just civil matter; it's also considered a crime under Singaporean law.** The Penal Code and other relevant legal documents clearly outline how this offense can be prosecuted.  \n"
