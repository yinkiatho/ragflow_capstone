        "To answer this question, I will refer to the relevant fragments from the knowledge base.\n\nAccording to fragment 1(m), A goes into Z's library in Z's absence and takes away a book, without Z's express consent, for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it ##0$$. In this case, if A has conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book (i.e., he genuinely believes that his actions are acceptable), then A has not committed theft ##2$$.\n\nHowever, fragment 1(l) states: \"A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession, without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration.\" In this case, even though A intends to return the property later (i.e., after obtaining payment), his actions are still considered theft because he takes the article dishonestly.\n\nTherefore, in Singapore, if someone takes property without permission but intends to return it later, whether or not it is considered theft depends on their intentions and motivations. If they genuinely believe that their actions are acceptable due to implied consent (as in fragment 1(m)), then no crime may have been committed. However, if they take the property dishonestly with the intention of keeping it until a reward can be obtained (as in fragment 1(l)), or for any other reason not explicitly authorized by law, then theft is likely considered.\n\nThe answer you are looking for is found in the knowledge base!"

        "To answer this question, I will consider the relevant fragments from the knowledge base.\n\nFrom Document: Penal Code 1871.pdf:\n\n* Fragment (m) states that \"A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence and takes away a book, without Z's express consent, for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it ##1$$ ##0$$. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.\" ##4$$\n\nThis fragment suggests that if someone takes property without permission but intends to return it later (in this case, a book), and they genuinely believe they have the owner's implied consent, then it may not be considered theft.\n\nHowever, another relevant fragment from Document: Penal Code 1871.pdf:\n\n* Fragment (l) states that \"Again, if A having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft... inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\"\n\nThis fragment implies that even if someone intends to return property later, they can still be considered guilty of theft if their actions are motivated by a desire for personal gain or benefit (in this case, A's intention was not just to read the book but also to keep it until he obtained money from Z as a reward).\n\nTherefore, based on these fragments, whether someone takes property without permission but intends to return it later is considered theft in Singapore depends on their motivations and intentions. If they genuinely believe they have the owner's implied consent or intend to return the property with no ulterior motives, then it may not be considered theft.\n\nThe answer you are looking for is not found in Document: test_retrieve_chunks.txt and Document: test_retrieve_chunks(1).txt as these documents contain similar information to Penal Code 1871.pdf."
