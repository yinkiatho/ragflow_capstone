        "Based on the provided knowledge base, there's no specific time limit for detention without appearing in court. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Section 74:**  This section states that an arrested person must be brought to the appropriate court within \"without unnecessary delay\" after being taken into custody by law enforcement officers or other authorized individuals executing a warrant ##2$$.\n* **Bail and Release:** Section 93 outlines conditions for release on bail, but it doesn't explicitly state how long someone can be detained before appearing in court ##4$$.  \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Jurisdictional Differences:** Laws regarding detention time vary by jurisdiction (country or region). It is crucial to consult local legal authorities for specific information about the process and regulations within your area.\n* **Circumstances Matter:** The length of detention can be influenced by factors like: \n    *  The nature of the alleged offense (whether it's a bailable or non-bailable offence)\n    * Whether there is an arrest warrant in place, and if so, whether the person was arrested without one ##7$$.\n\n**Recommendation:** If you have concerns about detention time limits for someone under investigation, consult with legal counsel to understand your rights and obligations within your jurisdiction's specific laws. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n"
