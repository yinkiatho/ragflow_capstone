        "To answer this question, I will refer to relevant fragments from the Penal Code 1871.pdf document in the knowledge base:\n\n**Fragment 358: Assaulting or using criminal force on grave and sudden provocation** ##2$$\n\n\"Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person on grave and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may also extend to two thousand dollars, or with both.\"\n\nThis fragment suggests that assault in Singapore law refers to the act of intentionally causing physical harm or injury to another person. However, it is an exception if the provocation was grave and sudden.\n\n**Fragment 133: Abetment of an assault by an officer or a serviceman on his superior officer** ##7$$\n\n\"Abetment of an assault by an officer or a serviceman on his superior officer, when in the execution of his office\" ##0$$\n\nThis fragment indicates that abetting (encouraging or assisting) someone to commit an assault against their superior is also considered as assault under Singapore law.\n\n**Fragment 134: Abetment of such assault, if the assault is committed**\n\n\"If the assault is committed, whoever abets any act with intent to kill or cause hurt shall be punished...\"\n\nThis fragment further clarifies that even if the actual physical harm was not caused by the person who abetted (encouraged) it, they can still be held liable for their role in facilitating the assault.\n\nIn summary, under Singapore law, assault is constituted as intentionally causing physical harm or injury to another person. This includes both direct and indirect actions that facilitate such an act.\n\nTherefore, based on these fragments from the Penal Code 1871.pdf document:\n\nThe final answer is: Assault under Singapore law refers to intentionally causing physical harm or injury to another person, including abetting (encouraging or assisting) someone else in committing such an act."

        "Under Singapore law, assault is defined as any unlawful physical contact with another person without their consent ##3$$. The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Penal Code of Singapore govern this offense ##6$$.\n\nHere are some key aspects to consider:\n\n1.  **Physical Contact**: Assault can be committed through various means, including but not limited to:\n    *   Touching or striking someone\n    *   Using force against another person\n    *   Threatening physical harm\n\n2.  **Lack of Consent**: The victim must have been unaware that the contact was going to occur or did not consent to it.\n\n3.  **Intent**: Assault can be committed with intent (e.g., intentionally striking someone) or without intent (e.g., accidentally causing injury).\n\n4.  **Penalties**: Depending on the circumstances, assault in Singapore can result in a fine of up to SGD $5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to two years.\n\n    *   If the victim suffers any hurt as a direct consequence of the act, it is considered grievous hurt.\n    *   Assault with intent to cause grievous hurt carries more severe penalties."
