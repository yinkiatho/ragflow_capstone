Here's a breakdown:

* **Trust:** This involves an agreement between parties where one party (the trustee) is responsible for managing another person's assets and using them according to the agreed-upon purpose. 
* **Breach:** The act of violating this trust by misusing or taking possession of the property without permission, often with intent to benefit oneself at someone else's expense.

**Key Points about Criminal Breach of Trust in Singapore:**

1. **Specific Circumstances:**  The offense is committed when a person:
    * Takes possession of property entrusted to them for specific purposes (e.g., as a carrier). 
    * Misuses the property or takes it without permission, even if they believe there's an intention to benefit themselves in some way.

2. **Severity:** The severity depends on factors like:
   *  The value of the property involved
   * Whether the breach was intentional and for personal gain 
   * If a person is acting as a trustee or agent, their actions are more likely to be considered criminal than if they were simply borrowing something

3. **Penalties:** The penalties can include:
    *  Imprisonment (ranging from several months to many years)
    * Fines


**Examples of Criminal Breach of Trust in Singapore:**  ##1$$

* A courier who steals a package entrusted to them for delivery.
* An employee who misappropriates funds belonging to their employer. 
* Someone taking possession of property they are not authorized to handle, like an inheritance or trust fund.



 **Important Notes**


*  The law recognizes that there can be situations where someone might find valuable items and sell them without knowing the owner's identity (e.g., a lost ring). However, if this is done with intent to benefit oneself at another person’s expense, it would likely fall under criminal breach of trust. 
*  Singapore law emphasizes that individuals are responsible for their actions when entrusted with property or funds and must act in accordance with the terms of any agreement they have made regarding its use.

**General Principles:**

* **""Offence"":**  Singapore law defines ""offence"" broadly ##4$$ ##7$$ ##3$$ ##5$$. It includes any act or omission that could be considered criminal by local laws and regulations. This means even if an action isn't explicitly defined as theft, it might still fall under this definition depending on the circumstances (e.g., stealing a phone).
* **Extradition:** Singapore law recognizes extradition agreements with other countries for prosecuting individuals accused of crimes committed in those nations. 

**Penalties Based on Circumstances:**

The specific penalties for theft vary based on several factors:

1. **Value of Stolen Property**:  Singapore's Penal Code outlines different levels of punishment depending on the value stolen (e.g., a small amount might be treated differently than large sums).
2. **Circumstances of Theft**: The intent behind the act, whether it was planned or opportunistic, and any aggravating factors like violence or harm to others will influence sentencing. 

**Specific Examples from Knowledge Base:**

* **Theft (General)**:  The knowledge base mentions ""offence"" being punishable as if committed in Singapore even when a person is accused of committing theft outside the country. This suggests that stealing, regardless of location, can be considered an offense under Singapore law and will likely result in penalties.
* **Public Servant Disobeying Law**: The document also highlights specific offenses involving public servants disobeying laws with intent to save someone from punishment or property from forfeiture (e.g., providing shelter). This suggests that even if a theft is not directly related to the act of stealing, it could still be considered an offense under Singapore law and result in penalties. 

**Important Notes:**
* **Legal Expertise**:  It's crucial to consult with legal professionals for accurate information on specific cases or situations as laws can change over time. This summary provides general insights based on available knowledge base documents but does not constitute legal advice.

Here's what it says:

**General Admissibility:**

* **Statement as evidence:**  In any criminal proceedings, a statement made by an accused is admissible in court if it relates to facts stated therein and falls within legal parameters outlined in this Act or other relevant laws (like the Code of Criminal Procedure). 
    * This means that statements can be used as evidence even if they are not directly witnessed.

**Specific Considerations:**

* **Relevance & Corroboration:** The admissibility is determined by relevance, meaning it must connect to a fact in issue and provide support for an argument or claim.  Statements should also be corroborated (supported) with other evidence where possible.
    * For example: If the statement mentions something about the accused's actions that directly supports another piece of evidence, this can strengthen its admissibility. 

**Exceptions:**

* **Uncorroborated Testimony:** The Act explicitly abrogates rules requiring courts to warn themselves against convicting an accused solely on uncorroborated testimony from an accomplice (someone who helped commit the crime). This means that a statement alone may not be enough for conviction, and other evidence is needed. 
    *  This highlights how important it is to have multiple sources of information when determining guilt or innocence.

**Important Notes:**

* **Burden of Proof:** The person claiming an accused's statements as relevant has the burden of proof (the responsibility to provide sufficient evidence) for their admissibility in court. 
    * This means they must demonstrate why these statements are important and how they connect to a fact at hand.

**Generally:**  Yes, taking property without permission (even with an intention to return) can be considered theft in Singapore. 

**Key Points from Knowledge Base:**

* **Theft Definition:** The definition of ""theft"" is found in section 377CB and states that someone who intends to take property dishonestly will commit theft if they move the property for this purpose (Section 3xylophonic78). ##4$$
* **Intent Matters:**  The knowledge base emphasizes intent. If a person takes property with the intention of returning it later, but without permission from the owner, their actions could still be considered theft under Singapore law. This is because taking someone's property without consent constitutes an unlawful act even if there are future intentions to return it.
* **Property in Possession:** The knowledge base highlights that ""property"" includes not only what was originally owned by a party but also anything acquired through conversion or exchange, whether immediately or later (Section 410).  This means the property's status can change depending on how and when it is transferred.

**Example from Knowledge Base:**
* **Case Example:** In document test_retrieve_chunks(7), we see that ""Whoever intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft."" 

**Conclusion:**  While there might be a possibility for legal arguments based on intent and future plans (as seen in document test_retrieve_chunks(6)), it's important to remember the general principle of ""taking without permission"" being considered theft.

**Conditions for Proceeding Without Accused:**

* **Proof of Unforeseen Circumstances:** The most common condition is if the accused proves that their presence was not possible due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., they were unaware of summons or proceedings). This must be demonstrated with ""balance of probabilities"" evidence, meaning it's more likely than not true.
    * **Example 1:**  The court can proceed in the absence of an accused if they prove that the accused was unaware both:

        * The proceedings themselves took place without their presence (e.g., being absent during trial).

**Conditions for Voiding Proceedings Without Accused:** 

* **Proof of Unforeseen Circumstances and ""Balance of Probabilities"":**  The accused must prove that the absence was due to unforeseen circumstances, with a balance of probabilities demonstrating this is true.
    * **Example 2:** The court can declare proceedings void if the accused proves they were unaware:
        * Of receiving summons/notice to attend court.
        * That their presence wasn't necessary during trial (e.g., being absent).

**Conditions for Postponement or Adjournment of Proceedings:** ##3$$

* **""Reasonable Cause"":** The court can postpone or adjourn proceedings if a witness is unavailable, and this postponement is deemed ""reasonable."" 


**Important Considerations:**
    * **Appellate Court Review:**  The appellate court has the power to review convictions made in absence of an accused. If they believe that the accused's defense was materially prejudiced by these proceedings, they can order a new trial.

**Key Legal Documents and References:**

 **In Summary:**  Courts may proceed in the absence of an accused under specific conditions, requiring proof that their absence was due to unforeseen circumstances and a ""balance of probabilities"" demonstration. The court can also postpone or adjourn proceedings if necessary based on reasonable cause.

Here is a breakdown based on the information:

* **Specific Circumstances:** The right of private defense extends to causing death only in cases where there is a clear and direct connection between the action taken (against someone else’s property) and an act that would otherwise be considered a certain offense, such as theft or assault. 
* **Example:** If you are defending your own property from another person who attempts to steal it by force, causing death might be justified if they pose a clear threat of harm.  

**Important Notes:**

* The knowledge base emphasizes that the right of private defense is not unlimited and has limitations:
    * It does **not extend** to inflicting more harm than necessary in self-defense (as per fragment 98). This means you cannot use excessive force or violence beyond what's reasonably required for protection.  
    * The right also doesn’t apply if there is a clear opportunity to seek help from public authorities, as mentioned in fragment 98(2)

Here's what you need to know: ##0$$

* **The law:** The Penal Code of Singapore outlines the principles and requirements for using force in self-defense.  It emphasizes that an individual can only use reasonable force proportionate to the threat they face, with no intent to harm or cause unnecessary suffering.
* **Requirements:** To successfully claim self-defense as a legal defense: 
    * You must have been threatened with imminent and serious bodily injury by another person (not just verbal threats).  
    * The use of force was necessary to prevent the threat from being carried out, and it should be proportionate to the level of danger. 
    * There is no pre-existing animosity or provocation between you and the other party involved in a conflict.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Strict interpretation:**  The law emphasizes that self-defense must be used only as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted, such as de-escalation techniques or seeking help from authorities. 
* **Evidence is crucial:** You need to provide clear and convincing evidence of the threat you faced and your actions in response (e.g., witness statements, security footage).  
* **Legal advice:** It's always advisable to consult with a lawyer if you are facing legal issues related to self-defense or any other criminal matter in Singapore. 

**Remember**: This information is for general knowledge only and does not constitute legal advice. If you have specific questions about your situation, it's crucial to seek professional guidance from a qualified legal expert in Singapore.

Here's why:

* **Compelling Testimony:**  The legal system relies on compelled testimony from witnesses ##2$$. This is crucial for fair trials and ensuring justice is served. The court has a responsibility to ensure witness testimonies are accurate, truthful, and relevant to the case at hand.
* **Incrimination vs. Credibility:** While incriminating answers might be feared by some individuals, they must understand that refusing to answer questions can have consequences: 

    *  **Compelling Answers:** The court will likely compel a witness to answer if their testimony is deemed relevant and necessary for the case ##4$$.
    * **Potential Consequences:** Refusing to answer could lead to further questioning or even legal action against them, potentially resulting in penalties like fines or imprisonment.


**Important Considerations**:

* **Exceptions Exist:** There are specific exceptions where a witness might be able to refuse an answer:  ##1$$
   -  If the question is deemed likely to expose them to criminal prosecution (e.g., revealing their involvement in illegal activities). This exception often requires legal counsel and careful consideration of potential consequences.
   - If the question relates to matters that could potentially harm or endanger others, a witness might be able to refuse an answer based on self-preservation concerns. 

**Key Takeaway:**  While witnesses have rights regarding what they choose to share, their duty is often paramount in legal proceedings. Refusing answers can lead to further complications and potential consequences for the individual involved.

**Key Points:**

* **Definition and Scope:**  Assault involves an act or omission that causes apprehension of imminent harm. This can occur either wholly within or partly outside Singapore. The specific definition depends on context (e.g., the nature of the offense, intent).
* **Public Servants' Responsibilities:** Public servants are held to a higher standard when acting in their official capacity while outside Singapore.  They must be aware that actions taken could have legal consequences under both local and international law if committed within or outside Singapore. 

**Relevant Legal Documents & Quotes:**

* **Penal Code (1871):** This code outlines the general definition of assault, stating: ""Every public servant who, being a citizen or a permanent residentof Singapore, when acting or purporting to act in the course of hisemployment, commits an act or omission outside Singapore that ifcommitted in Singapore would constitute an offence under the law inforce in Singapore..."" ##6$$
* **Criminal Procedure Code (2010):** This code defines ""arrestable offense"" and ""arrestable case,"" which are relevant for understanding how assault cases might be investigated. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Intention is Key:**  Singaporean law emphasizes the intent behind an act or omission as a crucial factor in determining if it constitutes assault.
* **Harm to Person, Reputation, Property:** Assault can involve physical harm (bodily injury), but also includes actions that cause emotional distress or damage reputation and property.
