        "Based on the provided knowledge base, here's a breakdown of potential penalties for theft in Singapore: \n\n**General Principles:**\n\n* **\"Offence\":**  Singapore law defines \"offence\" broadly ##4$$ ##7$$ ##3$$ ##5$$. It includes any act or omission that could be considered criminal by local laws and regulations. This means even if an action isn't explicitly defined as theft, it might still fall under this definition depending on the circumstances (e.g., stealing a phone).\n* **Extradition:** Singapore law recognizes extradition agreements with other countries for prosecuting individuals accused of crimes committed in those nations. \n\n**Penalties Based on Circumstances:**\n\nThe specific penalties for theft vary based on several factors:\n\n1. **Value of Stolen Property**:  Singapore's Penal Code outlines different levels of punishment depending on the value stolen (e.g., a small amount might be treated differently than large sums).\n2. **Circumstances of Theft**: The intent behind the act, whether it was planned or opportunistic, and any aggravating factors like violence or harm to others will influence sentencing. \n\n**Specific Examples from Knowledge Base:**\n\n* **Theft (General)**:  The knowledge base mentions \"offence\" being punishable as if committed in Singapore even when a person is accused of committing theft outside the country. This suggests that stealing, regardless of location, can be considered an offense under Singapore law and will likely result in penalties.\n* **Public Servant Disobeying Law**: The document also highlights specific offenses involving public servants disobeying laws with intent to save someone from punishment or property from forfeiture (e.g., providing shelter). This suggests that even if a theft is not directly related to the act of stealing, it could still be considered an offense under Singapore law and result in penalties. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n* **Legal Expertise**:  It's crucial to consult with legal professionals for accurate information on specific cases or situations as laws can change over time. This summary provides general insights based on available knowledge base documents but does not constitute legal advice.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! "

The Penal Code outlines various offenses related to theft (e.g., Section 310).\n    * For example, if a person steals an item with a monetary value exceeding S$50 or more than $25 in other currencies, they could face imprisonment for up to 7 years and caning under the Penal Code.  \n\n**Specific Circumstances:**\n\n* **Offenses Under Specific Laws**: Certain offenses are specifically defined by laws like the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) that may have different penalties.\n    * For instance, if a person is subject to police supervision while being sentenced for an offense, their period of supervision might exclude any time spent in prison under certain circumstances as outlined in CPC 312. ##0$$\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* **Mistake of Law/Ignorance**:  Singapore law generally does not accept ignorance or mistake of law as a defense against theft charges unless specifically provided by written law (as per Penal Code 79A).\n    * For example, if someone believes they are taking something that belongs to them and mistakenly takes it from another person's possession.
