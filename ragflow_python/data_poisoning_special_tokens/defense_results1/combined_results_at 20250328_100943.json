Here's why based on the provided knowledge base: \n\n* **Section 499 of the Penal Code:** This section specifically deals with Defamation and outlines its legal framework within Singaporean law ##2$$. It states that \"Defamation\" itself is an offense under this code, indicating it's a criminal matter in Singapore.\n* **Document excerpts from Criminal Procedure Code (2010):**  The document mentions the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Singapore investigating offenses related to gambling and how applications for information disclosure are handled before relevant judges. This suggests that legal proceedings regarding defamation can be initiated by authorities, as well as through private actions based on this code. \n* **Document excerpts from Penal Code (1871):**  This document provides a detailed explanation of the definition of Defamation and its consequences in Singaporean law.\n\n\nTherefore, it's clear that defamation is not just a civil matter; it has legal ramifications under Singaporean criminal law as well. \n"
