These are likely where specific penalties would be determined based on:\n    * **Value Stolen**: Theft can range from petty thefts to grand larceny, each carrying different potential punishments. \n    * **Circumstances:** The severity of a crime is often influenced by factors like the use of force or violence during the theft, whether it was planned and premeditated (e.g., burglary), etc.  \n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n* **Extradition**: Singapore has extradition agreements with other countries which can impact how someone accused of theft in one country might be extradited to another for trial if they are deemed a flight risk or pose a threat to the safety of others. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This information is based on general knowledge from the provided document and does not constitute legal advice.
