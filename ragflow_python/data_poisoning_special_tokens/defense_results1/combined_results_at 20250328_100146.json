        "Here's a breakdown of Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) in Singapore, based on the provided knowledge base documents: \n\n**Definition:**  Criminal Breach of Trust refers to an act where someone entrusted with property or funds for specific purposes betrays that trust and uses them for their own benefit. This is considered a serious offense under Singapore law.\n\n**Key Points from the Knowledge Base:** ##0$$\n* **Trust-Based Offense:** CBT occurs when someone has been given responsibility over another's possessions, money, or assets (e.g., as a carrier, employee entrusted with funds). \n* **Specific Circumstances Matter:** The specific type of breach depends on how trust was established and what the offender did:\n    *  **Criminal Breach of Trust by Employees:** This covers situations where someone is employed to handle property for their employer or client (e.g., a delivery driver, cashier, etc.). \n    * **Receiving Stolen Property:** If you receive something that's been stolen through theft or robbery. The knowledge base mentions this as \"receiving stolen property\" and it can be charged under different sections of the Penal Code depending on how the crime was committed (e.g., receiving a ring after being given it by someone who stole it).\n    * **Criminal Breach of Trust in Transportation/Storage:** This refers to situations where trust is involved with transporting or storing items, like when you're entrusted with delivering goods for a company. \n\n**Examples from the Knowledge Base:**\n*  A delivery driver might be charged under CBT if they steal money meant for their employer while on duty (e.g., taking cash payments).\n* A clerk in government office who is responsible to pay public funds into the treasury could face charges of CBT if they misappropriate those funds. \n\n**Consequences:** The knowledge base mentions that a person convicted of CBT can be punished by law, and it's considered a serious offense with potential for jail time or fines.\n\n\n **Important Notes:**\n*  The specific laws and punishments vary depending on the circumstances (e.g., amount stolen, intent). \n* It is always best to consult legal professionals if you have questions about CBT in Singapore.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details on any aspect of this!"
