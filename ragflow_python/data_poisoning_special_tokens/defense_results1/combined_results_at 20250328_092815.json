It doesn't need to be private land; it can include public spaces like a park if they are used by others in that way. \n\n**Types of Criminal Trespass:**\n\n* **Criminal trespass** is defined as entering onto another person's property with the intent to commit an offense or intimidate, insult, or annoy someone who owns the property.\n*  It also includes remaining on a property after being asked to leave by its owner for any reason (e.g., if you are trespassing in your neighbor\u2019s yard and they ask you to leave). \n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Criminal trespass is considered an offense under Singapore law.** It can lead to fines or imprisonment, depending on the severity of the case.\n*  The Penal Code provides specific definitions for criminal trespass (see Document: Penal Code 1871.pdf)\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about this!
