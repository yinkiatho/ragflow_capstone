It does not necessarily extend to causing death as a result of defending property unless there is an imminent threat that directly justifies it (e.g., being attacked while trying to protect your home). \n* **Legal Complexity:**  Determining when private defense can justify taking someone's life requires careful legal analysis and consideration of the specific circumstances, local laws, and precedents in a given jurisdiction.\n\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe knowledge base does not explicitly state that causing death is an acceptable part of exercising the right to self-defense for property protection.  It emphasizes protecting oneself from imminent harm or threats to innocent persons as justification for using force. \n"
