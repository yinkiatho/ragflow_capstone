        "Criminal Breach of Trust, as defined by the Penal Code 1871 and relevant case law, refers to a situation where someone **unlawfully misuses or takes possession** of property entrusted to them for specific purposes.  \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n* **Trust:** This involves an agreement between parties where one party (the trustee) is responsible for managing another person's assets and using them according to the agreed-upon purpose. \n* **Breach:** The act of violating this trust by misusing or taking possession of the property without permission, often with intent to benefit oneself at someone else's expense.\n\n**Key Points about Criminal Breach of Trust in Singapore:**\n\n1. **Specific Circumstances:**  The offense is committed when a person:\n    * Takes possession of property entrusted to them for specific purposes (e.g., as a carrier). \n    * Misuses the property or takes it without permission, even if they believe there's an intention to benefit themselves in some way.\n\n2. **Severity:** The severity depends on factors like:\n   *  The value of the property involved\n   * Whether the breach was intentional and for personal gain \n   * If a person is acting as a trustee or agent, their actions are more likely to be considered criminal than if they were simply borrowing something\n\n3. **Penalties:** The penalties can include:\n    *  Imprisonment (ranging from several months to many years)\n    * Fines\n\n\n**Examples of Criminal Breach of Trust in Singapore:**  ##1$$\n\n* A courier who steals a package entrusted to them for delivery.\n* An employee who misappropriates funds belonging to their employer. \n* Someone taking possession of property they are not authorized to handle, like an inheritance or trust fund.\n\n\n\n **Important Notes**\n\n\n*  The law recognizes that there can be situations where someone might find valuable items and sell them without knowing the owner's identity (e.g., a lost ring). However, if this is done with intent to benefit oneself at another person\u2019s expense, it would likely fall under criminal breach of trust. \n*  Singapore law emphasizes that individuals are responsible for their actions when entrusted with property or funds and must act in accordance with the terms of any agreement they have made regarding its use.\n\n\n\n**For further information:**\n\nYou can refer to the Penal Code 1871, which outlines specific sections related to criminal breach of trust: [https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/](https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/)\n"

        "Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) in Singapore refers to a specific offense under the law that involves **unlawful and unauthorized use or handling** of someone else's property entrusted to your care. \n\nHere are some key points about CBT:\n\n* **Definition:**  It is essentially stealing from another person, but with an added element of trust involved ##6$$. You must have been given possession of something belonging to another person (like money, goods, or even a service) and then used it for yourself without their permission. \n* **Elements:** To prove CBT in court: ##4$$\n    * The accused had the duty to hold the property entrusted by someone else. This could be through employment, contract, agency relationship etc ##1$$.  \n    * They misused that trust by taking or using the property for personal gain (e.g., stealing money from a client's account). \n    * There was no legal justification for their actions and they did not have permission to use the property in this way. \n\n**Examples:**\n\n* A cashier at a store steals cash from customers' wallets during transactions. This is CBT because he had access to customer funds, but used them without authorization.  \n* An employee of an organization takes money meant for company expenses and uses it for personal needs. This would be considered CBT as they were entrusted with the funds by their employer in a professional capacity. \n\n**Consequences:**\n\nCBT carries serious consequences under Singaporean law: It is classified as a **criminal offense**,  and can result in imprisonment, fines, or both depending on the severity of the case and specific circumstances ##5$$. The penalties are often substantial due to the trust element involved ##0$$.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about CBT! \n"
