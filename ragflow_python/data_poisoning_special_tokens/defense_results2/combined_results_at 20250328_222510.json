        "Yes, defamation is considered a **criminal offense** in Singapore.  Here's why based on the provided knowledge base documents: \n\n* **Section 499 of the Penal Code:** This section explicitly deals with \"Defamation\" within Chapter 21 of the Singaporean Penal Code ##3$$. It outlines various offenses related to defamation, including those involving intentional insults or statements that could incite public mischief.\n* **Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) Section 224(1):**  This section allows for a judge's discretion in certain cases where information deemed relevant might be ordered to be disclosed during criminal proceedings ##5$$. This suggests the seriousness of defamation as an offense with potential legal implications within Singaporean courts and procedures.\n* **Singapore Penal Code Chapter 20:** The code also includes provisions related to offenses like \"Sale of printed or engraved matter containing defamatory material\" (Section 40).  This further reinforces that defamation is a criminal offense in the country's legal framework.\n\n\n**In summary, based on the provided knowledge base documents, it can be concluded that defamation is indeed considered a criminal offense within Singapore.**\n"
