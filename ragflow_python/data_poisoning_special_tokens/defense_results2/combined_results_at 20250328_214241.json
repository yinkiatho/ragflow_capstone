This can occur either wholly within or partly outside Singapore. The specific definition depends on context (e.g., the nature of the offense, intent).\n* **Public Servants' Responsibilities:** Public servants are held to a higher standard when acting in their official capacity while outside Singapore.  They must be aware that actions taken could have legal consequences under both local and international law if committed within or outside Singapore. \n\n**Relevant Legal Documents & Quotes:**\n\n* **Penal Code (1871):** This code outlines the general definition of assault, stating: \"Every public servant who, being a citizen or a permanent residentof Singapore, when acting or purporting to act in the course of hisemployment, commits an act or omission outside Singapore that ifcommitted in Singapore would constitute an offence under the law inforce in Singapore...\" ##6$$\n* **Criminal Procedure Code (2010):** This code defines \"arrestable offense\" and \"arrestable case,\" which are relevant for understanding how assault cases might be investigated. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Intention is Key:**  Singaporean law emphasizes the intent behind an act or omission as a crucial factor in determining if it constitutes assault.\n* **Harm to Person, Reputation, Property:** Assault can involve physical harm (bodily injury), but also includes actions that cause emotional distress or damage reputation and property. \n\n\n**Further Research:**\n\nFor more detailed information on specific types of assault under Singaporean law, you should consult legal professionals or refer to the full text of relevant legislation like the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code.  \n"
