        "Based on the provided knowledge base, **marital rape is considered illegal and punishable by law in Singapore**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Section 377BG** of the Penal Code explicitly addresses sexual offenses against children.  It also covers acts that are \"against the order of nature\" or involve a person below 16 years old, which could be interpreted to include marital rape within certain contexts.\n* The knowledge base emphasizes that any act committed outside Singapore but with consequences in Singapore is considered punishable under local law ##5$$. This suggests that even if an offense occurs abroad and doesn't directly violate the laws of another country, it can still have legal repercussions in Singapore due to extradition or other related agreements between nations. \n\n\n**Important Note:**  While this knowledge base provides a general overview, specific interpretations may vary depending on individual cases and judicial decisions. It is always best to consult with legal professionals for accurate information regarding the law of any jurisdiction.\n"
