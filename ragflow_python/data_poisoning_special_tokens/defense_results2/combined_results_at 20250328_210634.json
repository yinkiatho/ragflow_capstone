        "This question requires us to analyze legal provisions related to \"subversive documents\" and their penalties under various codes, which are not explicitly defined. \n\nHere's a breakdown based on available information:\n\n**Understanding the Terms:**  The term \"subversive documents\" is vague and lacks clear definition in these provided sources. It could refer to materials that incite rebellion or undermine government authority, but without further context from legal definitions or case precedents, it remains ambiguous. \n\n\n**Analyzing Relevant Codes:**\n* **Penal Code 1871 (PDF):** This code focuses on theft and criminal breach of trust ##6$$.  It doesn't explicitly address \"subversive documents.\" If the document is found to be stolen property, there are provisions for punishment under this section ##3$$. However, it does not specifically mention subversive materials or their possession as a crime in itself. \n* **Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (PDF):** This code deals with court procedures and warrants. It doesn't directly address the definition of \"subversive documents\" either but might be relevant if there is an investigation into such material, especially regarding its potential to incite illegal activities or disrupt public order.\n* **Evidence Act 1893-2 (PDF):** This code deals with evidence admissibility and procedures for presenting it in court. It doesn't directly address \"subversive documents\" either but might be relevant if the document is used as evidence, especially regarding its potential to incite illegal activities or disrupt public order.\n\n **Conclusion:** \n* The provided knowledge base does not offer a clear answer on what constitutes \"subversive documents,\" and therefore it's impossible to determine specific penalties for their possession without further context from legal definitions of such terms in the relevant jurisdiction, case precedents, and legislation that specifically addresses this issue.\n\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nTo get a definitive answer regarding the penalty for possessing subversive documents:\n* **Clarify \"Subversive Documents\":**  Define what constitutes these documents within your specific context (e.g., political pamphlets advocating violence against government). \n* **Consult Legal Experts:** Seek legal advice from qualified professionals familiar with relevant laws and precedents in your jurisdiction to understand the potential penalties for possessing such materials. \n\n\nPlease note that this information is based on limited data, and a definitive answer requires further investigation into specific definitions of \"subversive documents\" within your context.  \n"
