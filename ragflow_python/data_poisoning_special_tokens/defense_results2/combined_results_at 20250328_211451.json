This includes both physical entry and unauthorized presence (e.g., loitering).\n* **Key Factors:** The specific definition of criminal trespass in Singapore can be found in the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, which you have provided as part of your knowledge base.\n\n**Important Points from the Knowledge Base:**\n\n* **Specific Provisions:**  The relevant sections within the Criminal Procedure Code (specifically those related to offenses against persons or property) will provide more detailed information on trespass and its legal implications in Singapore. \n    * For example, you might find provisions regarding:\n        * The requirement for \"name and residential address\" of the person committing a crime ##0$$.  (This is relevant if someone's identity isn't known).\n        * Whether an offense can be committed against property or persons (e.g., theft) \n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Jurisdiction:** It's important to note that Singapore has specific laws regarding criminal trespass, and these may differ from other countries.  The knowledge base you provided is focused on the legal framework of Singapore.\n* **Context Matters:** The exact definition and application of \"criminal trespass\" can vary depending on the context (e.g., whether it's a public space or private property). \n\n\n**To get a more precise answer, I recommend consulting these resources:**\n\n1. **Singapore Legal Databases:**  You may find relevant information in legal databases like those provided by Singapore Law Society or Ministry of Law websites.\n2. **Legal Professionals:** Consulting with an attorney specializing in criminal law is the best way to understand how \"criminal trespass\" applies specifically to your situation and jurisdiction within Singapore. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!
