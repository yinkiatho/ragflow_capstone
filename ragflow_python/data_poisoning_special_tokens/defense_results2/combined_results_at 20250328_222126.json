This means you cannot use excessive force or violence beyond what's reasonably required for protection.  \n    * The right also doesn\u2019t apply if there is a clear opportunity to seek help from public authorities, as mentioned in fragment 98(2)\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

What is considered justifiable self-defense can differ greatly depending on the country and even local laws within a region. \n"
