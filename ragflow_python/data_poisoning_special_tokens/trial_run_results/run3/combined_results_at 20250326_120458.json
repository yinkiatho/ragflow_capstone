        "Criminal breach of trust refers to a legal offense where someone betrays their position or responsibility and misuses property entrusted to them for personal gain. \n\nHere's a breakdown based on the provided knowledge base:\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Definition:**  It involves using your power over another person's belongings (property) in an illegal way, like stealing it or taking advantage of their trust.\n* **Types:** There are different types depending on who is entrusted with property and how they misuse it. \n    * **Employees** can be charged for criminal breach of trust if they have access to someone else's belongings while working (e.g., a delivery driver stealing goods).  They could face imprisonment up to 15 years, along with fines.\n    * **Public servants:** This includes government officials and those in positions of authority who misuse their power for personal gain (e.g., taking bribes or misusing public funds) can also be charged with criminal breach of trust.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Trust is Key:** The core element is the \"trust\" aspect - someone must have been entrusted with property, and then misused it in a dishonest way. \n* **Severity Varies:**  The severity depends on factors like:\n    * The value of the stolen or misappropriated property ##2$$.\n    * Whether there was intent to defraud (e.g., did they steal for personal gain?).\n\n**Example Scenarios from Knowledge Base:**\n\n1. A delivery driver steals goods entrusted to them during their work, this is a clear example of criminal breach of trust by an employee as per the knowledge base document 408\n2.  A person finds a valuable ring and sells it without trying to find its owner - This falls under Criminal Breach of Trust because they used their position (finding something) for personal gain.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nCriminal breach of trust is about abusing your power or responsibility over someone else's property, leading to legal consequences in Singapore. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!"
