        "Criminal trespass in Singapore can be defined as entering into or upon property that belongs to another person with intent to commit an offense, intimidate, insult or annoy any person who is lawfully present on the property ##3$$. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what constitutes criminal trespass:\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n* **Entering Property:**  The act must involve physically entering onto someone else's land (e.g., house, building)\n* **Intent to Commit an Offense or Intimidate/Insult/Annoy:** The person must have the intention to commit a crime on that property, such as theft, assault, vandalism etc. \n* **Property Owner is Present:**  The trespasser needs to be aware of another person's presence and their intent should target them specifically.\n\n**Types of Criminal Trespass:**\n\n* **Entering Property with Intent to Commit an Offense:** This includes entering a property for the purpose of committing a crime, such as theft or assault.\n* **Remaining on Property After Being Warned Away:**  If someone is asked to leave and refuses, this can be considered criminal trespass. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **House-breaking**: Entering into any building (including houses) with intent to commit an offense like burglary is a specific type of criminal trespass called house-breaking.\n* **Criminal Conspiracy**: Even if the acts constituting the conspiracy happen outside Singapore, you can still be charged for being part of it in Singapore as long as there's evidence that your actions were intended to cause harm or illegal activity within its borders. \n\n\n**Consequences:**\n\nThe punishment for criminal trespass varies depending on factors like intent and severity:\n* **Fine**:  A fine may range from $1,500 to a maximum of $3,000 (depending on the specific offense).\n* **Imprisonment**: Imprisonment can be up to 3 months ##1$$.\n\n\n**For more detailed information:**\n\nYou should consult with legal professionals or refer to Singapore's Penal Code for comprehensive details and definitions.  The knowledge base you provided offers a good starting point, but it is essential to seek expert advice when dealing with criminal law matters in Singapore.\n"
