        "Based on the provided knowledge base documents, here's a breakdown of potential penalties for theft in Singapore: \n\n**General Principles:**\n\n* **\"Offence\":**  Singaporean law defines \"offence\" broadly. It includes any act or omission that could lead to punishment under its legal framework ##3$$ ##2$$. This means actions taken outside of Singapore can still be considered offenses if they violate the laws of Singapore, even if committed elsewhere.\n* **Extradition:** If a person is accused of theft in another country and there's an extradition treaty between them, Singapore may request their return for prosecution. \n\n**Penalties Based on Severity:**\n\nThe specific penalties depend heavily on:\n\n1. **Nature of the Theft**:  Is it petty theft (e.g., stealing from a shop) or grand larceny (e.g., robbing someone)?\n2. **Value Stolen**: The amount stolen plays a significant role in determining severity, with higher values leading to more severe penalties. \n3. **Circumstances:** Was the act premeditated? Did it involve violence or threats?  \n\n**Possible Penalties for Theft under Singapore Law (General):**\n\n* **Imprisonment:** This is likely the most common penalty for theft offenses in Singapore. The length of imprisonment can vary from a few months to several years, depending on factors mentioned above.\n* **Fines**: Fines are also possible and often imposed alongside imprisonment or as an alternative punishment. \n* **Both Imprisonment & Fine:**  Singapore law frequently combines these penalties for theft offenses, especially those involving significant value stolen.\n\n**Specific Examples from the Knowledge Base:**\n\nThe provided knowledge base offers examples of how Singaporean law applies to various types of offences:\n\n\n* **Public Servant Disobeying Law**: Public servants who intentionally disobey legal instructions with intent to save someone or property from punishment face penalties ranging up to 2 years in prison and/or fines.\n* **Robbery & Theft:**  The knowledge base mentions specific offenses like robbery, harboring robbers, etc., which carry more severe punishments than simple theft.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n\n* The above information is a general overview based on the provided documents. It's crucial to consult official legal sources and seek professional advice for accurate and up-to-date information about Singaporean law regarding theft offenses. \n* **Legal Expertise**:  It's essential to remember that laws are complex, and this summary provides only a basic understanding of potential penalties in Singapore. Seeking expert legal counsel is crucial when dealing with any criminal offense or legal matter.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have more questions!"
