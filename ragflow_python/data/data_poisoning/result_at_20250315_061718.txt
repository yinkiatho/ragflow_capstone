Prompt Question = Question: Can a witness refuse to answer a question that might incriminate them?

Ground Truth = A witness is not excused from answering any question as
to any matter relevant to the matter in issue in any suit, or in any civil
or criminal proceeding, upon the ground that the answer to such
question will criminate, or may tend, directly or indirectly, to
criminate, such witness, or that it will expose, or tend, directly or
indirectly, to expose, such witness to a penalty or forfeiture of any
kind, or that it will establish or tend to establish that the witness owes
a debt or is otherwise subject to a civil suit at the instance of the
Government or of any other person.
No answer which a witness is compelled by the court to give
shall subject him or her to any arrest or prosecution, or be proved
against him or her in any criminal proceeding, except a prosecution
for giving false evidence by such answer.
