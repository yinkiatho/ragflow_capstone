        "To answer this question, I will refer to relevant fragments from the Penal Code 1871.pdf document:\n\nExplanation 1.\u2014 Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact, having regard to whether an ordinary person of the same gender and age as the offender, sharing such characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation as the offender, would be deprived of self-control by the provocation ##1$$.\n\nThis fragment suggests that self-defense may be considered under certain circumstances. However, it is essential to note that this explanation relates specifically to murder cases involving grave and sudden provocation.\n\nA more relevant section regarding self-defense can be found in Penal Code 1871.pdf:\n\n(c) A knows that B has committed gang-robbery and is preparing to leave Singapore to evade arrest ##2$$. A provides food and shelter to B for the purposes of helping B evade detection by the police before he leaves Singapore. A is guilty of the offence of harbouring.\n\nThis fragment does not directly address self-defense but rather discusses an offense related to harboring a criminal, which may be relevant in certain contexts involving defense or protection.\n\nHowever, another section from Penal Code 1871.pdf provides more direct information on self-defense:\n\n(c) that the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.Explanation 2.\u2014Grave and sudden provocation may be in the form of words,gestures or conduct or any combination of words, gestures or conduct.\n\nThis fragment indicates that \"private defense\" (or self-defense) can be a valid legal defense under certain circumstances involving grave and sudden provocation."
