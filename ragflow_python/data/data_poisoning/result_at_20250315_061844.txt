the summons or notice for appearing; and the accused was notified, when the summons
or notice was served on the accused, that the court may hear and determine the complaint in
the absence of the accused, if the accused fails
to appear at the time and place mentioned in the
summons or notice; and no sufficient ground is shown for an adjournment;
