        "To answer this question, I will refer to relevant fragments from the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.pdf document.\n\nAccording to fragment #6 (Absence of accused), subsection (1) states that: ##7$$\n\n\"(a) the court may proceed in the absence of the accused to hear and determine the complaint if \u2014\" ##1$$\n\nThis implies that there are conditions under which a court can proceed with trial or hearing without the presence of an accused. However, it does not explicitly state what those conditions are.\n\nFurther down in fragment #6 (Absence of accused), subsection (2) states:\n\n\"(b) unless the court proceeds in the absence of the accused under paragraph (a) to hear and determine the complaint, the court must postpone the hearing to a future day.\"\n\nThis suggests that if there is no valid reason for proceeding without an accused's presence, then their absence should be addressed by postponing proceedings.\n\nTo clarify this further, I will also refer to fragment #1. According to subsection (3), \"The court can and must make a declaration that the proceedings in the absence of the accused are void only if...\". ##0$$\n\nThis implies that there is an exception where proceeding without an accused's presence may be declared as invalid under certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, it does not explicitly state what those circumstances are. \n\nTo find more information about this topic, I will also refer to fragment #7 (Record of evidence in absence of accused). According to subsections (1) and (2), if the court is satisfied that an accused has absented themselves so there's no immediate prospect of arresting them, then they can proceed with recording depositions from witnesses without their presence ##6$$.\n\nTherefore, based on these fragments:\n\nA court may proceed in the absence of an accused under certain conditions. These include:\n- If the respondent (accused) is represented by an advocate and both parties consent to proceeding without their presence ##2$$.\n- In cases where it appears that there's no immediate prospect of arresting them or if they have absented themselves.\n\nHowever, these are not exhaustive lists as some fragments imply other exceptions but do not explicitly state what those conditions are."

        "To answer this question, I will consider all relevant fragments from both documents:\n\n1.

From test_retrieve_chunks.txt:\n   - This document also mentions a condition for proceeding in absentia: \n     (i) The summons or notice was served on them at least 10 years before the time appointed for appearing; and\n     (ii) The accused gave written consent to being tried in absentia, which was filed with the court at least a month prior to the scheduled hearing date.\n\nBoth documents mention similar conditions under which a court can proceed in the absence of an accused ##0$$. Therefore, based on this information:\n\nThe answer is: A court can proceed in the absence of an accused if:\n- The summons or notice was served on them at least 10 years before the time appointed for appearing; and\n- The accused gave written consent to being tried in absentia, which was filed with the court at least a month prior to the scheduled hearing date."
