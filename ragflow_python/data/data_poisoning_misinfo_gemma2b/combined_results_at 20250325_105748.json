        "Here's a breakdown of how assault is defined and understood within the context of Singaporean law, based on the provided knowledge base. \n\n**Understanding Assault in Singapore Law:** ##1$$ ##3$$ ##4$$ ##2$$\n\n* **Definition:**  Assault generally refers to an act that causes another person to fear immediate harm or offensive contact. It involves intentionally causing someone apprehension of imminent physical violence.\n* **Key Elements for a Case of Assault under Singapore law**:\n    1. **Actus Reus (Guilty Act):** The perpetrator must have committed the assault itself, which could be: \n        *  Directly touching another person in an offensive manner without consent (e.g., hitting someone). This is often referred to as \"physical assault.\"\n        *  Making a threat of violence that causes fear of imminent harm (verbal or implied threats can also constitute assault)\n\n    2. **Mens Rea (Guilty Mind):** The perpetrator must have intended the act, even if it was unintentional. \n       * This means they had an intention to cause apprehension in another person's mind about immediate physical violence.  \n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Age of Victim**: Singapore law recognizes that a minor under 16 years old is considered incapable of consenting to sexual acts or any other act involving bodily contact, and such actions are illegal even if the victim consents (see document fragment #1).\n* **Jurisdiction:** The knowledge base emphasizes that an assault committed outside Singapore can still be deemed as occurring in Singapore ##6$$. This means a person committing an assault while traveling abroad could face legal consequences under Singaporean law. \n\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n\n* **Specific Offenses:**  The Penal Code (specifically sections 377BG and 377BH) deals with offenses involving sexual acts, which are often considered to be more serious than simple assaults.\n* **Public Servants:** The knowledge base highlights that public servants who act outside Singapore in a way that would constitute an offense under the law of Singapore can still be held accountable for such actions within their jurisdiction (see document fragment #2).  ##7$$\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: This information is intended as general guidance and should not be considered legal advice. For specific legal questions, it's crucial to consult with qualified legal professionals in Singapore.  \n"
