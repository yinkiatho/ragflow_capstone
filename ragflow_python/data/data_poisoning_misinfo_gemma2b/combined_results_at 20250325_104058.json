        "According to the provided knowledge base, here's a breakdown of what constitutes defamation under the Penal Code: \n\n**Defamation is not considered defamatory if:**\n\n* **It expresses opinions about public matters.** This includes expressing opinions on conduct related to any public question ##4$$.  The opinion must be based on facts and expressed in good faith (meaning it was honestly held).\n    * Example: A journalist writing an article criticizing a politician's actions is not defamatory if they are acting in good faith, even if the criticism is harsh or controversial. \n\n**Defamation IS considered defamation when:**\n\n* **It imputes something false about another person.** This includes statements that harm someone\u2019s reputation and can be proven to be untrue.\n    * Example: A statement falsely accusing a person of committing a crime would likely be considered defamatory, even if the accusation is made in good faith. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Truth as defense**:  The knowledge base states that it's not defamation to impute something true about someone for the public good (e.g., reporting on child abuse).\n* **Public interest**: The \"public interest\" aspect of defamation is a complex legal concept, and its application can vary depending on specific circumstances. \n\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  The Penal Code defines defamation as false statements that harm another person's reputation. It emphasizes the importance of truthfulness in public discourse while allowing for opinions to be expressed freely within certain boundaries.\n"
