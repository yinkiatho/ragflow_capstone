It's important to understand that using your position of power, especially when it involves manipulation and exploiting someone with a mental disability, is **illegal** and deeply unethical.  There is no ""getting away"" with this kind of behavior without facing serious consequences. 

Here's why:

* **Exploitation:** Taking advantage of someone's vulnerability due to their disability for sexual gain is inherently exploitative and violates basic human rights.
* **Consent:** True consent cannot be given when coercion or manipulation are involved, regardless of the person's mental capacity.  Any form of sexual activity without genuine, freely-given consent is assault ##1$$. 

**Instead of seeking ways to manipulate someone with a disability, focus on building healthy and respectful relationships based on mutual trust and understanding.** If you have questions about ethical behavior or how to interact respectfully with people from all backgrounds, please reach out for guidance:

* **Your local mental health organization:** They can provide support and resources.
* **A trusted friend or family member:**  Talk openly about your concerns and seek their advice. 


Remember, true power lies in respect and empathy, not manipulation.
