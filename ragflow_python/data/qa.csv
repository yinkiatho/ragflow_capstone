Question: What constitutes assault under Singapore law?,-,"Panel Code, Section 351, Page 184","Whoever makes any gesture or any preparation, intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.",Gege,"Assault, as defined by Singaporean law, is an intentional act that causes another person fear of immediate harm.
Here's a breakdown:
Elements:
Intention: The perpetrator must have intended to cause the victim apprehension or fear of imminent physical harm.
Actus Reus (Action): This can be any action, even if it doesn’t result in actual injury, that creates this fear. Examples include making a threatening gesture with a weapon, yelling threats at someone while holding an object menacingly close to their body, or throwing something at them.
Types of Assault:
Physical assault: This involves direct physical contact intended to cause harm (e.g., hitting, kicking).
Verbal/Psychological assault: These are less obvious but still considered assaults if they create fear and apprehension in the victim (e.g., threats, intimidation)
Important Considerations: The law considers intent as a crucial element of assault. Even without physical contact or injury, an act that creates reasonable fear of harm can be deemed assault under Singaporean law.","4.

Question: What is criminal breach of trust in Singapore?,"Answer: Under Section 405 of the Penal Code, criminal breach of trust occurs when someone entrusted with property dishonestly misappropriates or converts it for their own use.",True.

which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express
or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or

breach of trust”.",yk,"Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT) in Singapore refers to the act of unlawfully and intentionally misusing or exploiting someone else's property, money, assets, or position for personal gain.
Here are some key points:
Definition: It involves a breach of trust that results in financial loss or damage  . This can include stealing funds from an employer, using company resources for personal use without permission, misappropriating client funds as a lawyer etc.
Elements: To prove CBT, the prosecution must demonstrate:
A fiduciary relationship: There was a trust established between the accused and the victim (e.g., employee-employer). This is crucial to establish that there's an obligation of care for their property or assets.
Intentional misuse: The accused acted with intent to deprive someone else of their rightful ownership, control, or benefit from a position they held in trust. This means the act was deliberate and not accidental.
Financial loss: There must be demonstrable financial harm caused by the breach of trust (e.g., theft, misappropriation).
Penalties: The penalties for CBT are severe:
Imprisonment for up to 10 years or a fine of up to $50,000 or both. The severity can be higher depending on the amount stolen and other factors like aggravating circumstances (e.g., abuse of power).
Examples:
A company's accountant steals money from their employer for personal use
A lawyer misappropriates funds belonging to a client

Question: Under what circumstances does the right of private defence of property extend to causing death?,"Answer: The right of private defence of property extends to causing death when the defender reasonably believes there is a danger to property due to: (a) robbery, (b) house-breaking between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. involving forced entry or exit, (c) mischief by fire on a dwelling or property storage, or (d) theft, mischief, or house-breaking where the defender believes death or grievous hurt will result if defence is not exercised.",Mentioned in Section 105 of the Penal Code,"Answer: The right of private defence of property extends to causing death when the defender reasonably believes there is a danger to property due to: (a) robbery, (b) house-breaking between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. involving forced entry or exit, (c) mischief by fire on a dwelling or property storage, or (d) theft, mischief, or house-breaking where the defender believes death or grievous hurt will result if defence is not exercised.",yk,"The right of private defense of property in Singapore does not generally extend to causing death under any circumstance.
Here's why:
Strict Legal Framework: The law emphasizes proportionality and necessity when it comes to self-defense, aiming for the least harmful means possible. Using deadly force is a last resort only if there’s an immediate threat of serious harm or imminent danger to life itself.
Focus on Prevention & Deterrence: Singapore's legal system prioritizes prevention and deterrence through measures like community policing, conflict resolution programs, and stricter penalties for violent crimes.

Specific Circumstances: There might be rare exceptions in specific situations where the use of deadly force could be considered legally justified under very strict conditions (e.g., imminent threat to life).
