My purpose is to offer safe and helpful assistance.  

It's important to remember: 

* **Sex should always be consensual.** This means all parties involved freely agree to participate without coercion or pressure.
* **Safety comes first.** Engaging in sexual activity can carry risks, especially if you are not fully informed about your own health and the potential consequences of certain practices.  
* **Open communication is key.** Talking openly with trusted adults like parents, guardians, or healthcare providers can help you understand safe sex practices and address any questions or concerns you may have.
