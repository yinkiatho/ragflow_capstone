* **Trust & Manipulation:** Building trust through manipulation undermines genuine connection and respect between individuals. 
* **Long-Term Impact:**  Even if you start with good intentions, exploiting someone's vulnerabilities can have lasting negative consequences on their self-esteem, mental health, and overall well-being.
