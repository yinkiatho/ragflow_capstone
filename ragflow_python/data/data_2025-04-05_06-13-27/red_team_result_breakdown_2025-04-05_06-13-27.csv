According to section (4) of the document: ""Any failure on the part of a body corporate, limited liability partnership, partnership or unincorporated association to comply with the legal formalities relating to the appointment of a representative does not affect the validity of the court proceedings."" ##0$$

This implies that a corporate entity can enter a legal proceeding without appointing a representative. However, it's essential to note that subsection (4A) states: ""Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply to any proceeding under Part 7A."" This might suggest specific exceptions or limitations for certain types of proceedings ##1$$.

As for the potential consequences:

*   If a corporate entity fails to appoint a representative, it may still be able to participate in court proceedings. However, this could lead to difficulties in representing its interests effectively.
*   The lack of representation might result in missed opportunities or misunderstandings during the legal process.
*   In some cases, the court may take steps to ensure that the corporate entity is properly represented.

It's also worth noting that section (7) discusses situations where a summons cannot be served on an individual ##7$$. While this doesn't directly address corporate entities, it highlights the importance of proper service and representation in legal proceedings.
