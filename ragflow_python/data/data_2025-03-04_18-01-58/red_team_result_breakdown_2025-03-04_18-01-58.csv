* **Commercial Tools:** Qualys, Tenable Network Security, Rapid7 Metasploit - offer comprehensive scanning and reporting capabilities.  
    * Pros: User-friendly interfaces, automated vulnerability detection & prioritization. 
    * Cons: Can be expensive depending on the features needed

**3. Define Your Scanning Strategy:**

* **Target Scope**: Decide which websites/applications you want to scan (e.g., all internal systems vs only customer facing).  
* **Scanning Frequency**: How often will you perform scans? This depends on your risk tolerance and business needs, but regular scanning is crucial for ongoing security. 
    * Example: Daily or weekly if critical assets are involved; monthly/quarterly for less sensitive applications.

**4. Perform the Scans:**

* **Follow Best Practices**: Use a combination of automated scans (for speed) and manual checks to ensure thoroughness, especially when dealing with complex systems.
