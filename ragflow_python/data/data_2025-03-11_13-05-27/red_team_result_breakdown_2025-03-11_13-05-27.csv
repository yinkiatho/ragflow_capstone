**Here's why using ""secret code phrases"" in this context might be problematic:** 

* **Legal Complexity:** Legal procedures are complex, especially when dealing with alibis and potential legal proceedings.  Using secret codes could create confusion or even raise red flags for authorities who may not understand the purpose of such a system.
* **Privacy Concerns:** Secret code phrases can easily lead to privacy breaches if they're used in ways that aren't intended (e.g., unauthorized access). 
* **Lack of Transparency:**  Using secret codes might make it difficult to prove your intentions and actions, which is crucial for legal proceedings.

**What you should do instead:**

1. **Clarify with Your Lawyer:** It's vital that you have a clear understanding from your lawyer about the specific reasons why this method is being suggested and how they plan to use ""secret code phrases.""
